# Nuts

This is boilerplate for a nodejs apps based on Hapi. I've borrowed some things from [hapi-ninja](https://github.com/poeticninja/hapi-ninja) and some conventions from Ruby on Rails.

# Running

To spin up the server on the default port (3000) just run `./nuts server`. To open a REPL you can run `./nuts console`.
